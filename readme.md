[**rehype**][rehype] plugin to bridge or mutate to [**retext**][retext].

Uses [`hast-util-to-nlcst`][to-nlcst] under the hood.
See its documentation to learn how to ignore nodes.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-retext
```

## Use

Say `example.html` looks as follows:

```html
<!doctype html>
<meta charset=utf8>
<title>Hello!</title>
<article>
  A implicit sentence.
  <h1>This and and that.</h1>
</article>
```

…and `example.js` like this:

```js
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var report = require('vfile-reporter')
var unified = require('unified')
var parse = require('rehype-parse')
var minify = require('rehype-preset-minify')
var stringify = require('rehype-stringify')
var rehype2retext = require('rehype-retext')
var english = require('retext-english')
var indefinite = require('retext-indefinite-article')
var repeated = require('retext-repeated-words')

unified()
  .use(parse)
  .use(
    rehype2retext,
    unified()
      .use(english)
      .use(indefinite)
      .use(repeated)
  )
  .use(minify)
  .use(stringify)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.html'), function(err, file) {
    console.error(report(err || file))
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```html
example.html
    5:3-5:4  warning  Use `An` before `implicit`, not `A`  retext-indefinite-article  retext-indefinite-article
  6:12-6:19  warning  Expected `and` once, not twice       retext-repeated-words      retext-repeated-words

⚠ 2 warnings
<!doctype html><meta charset=utf8><title>Hello!</title><article>A implicit sentence.<h1>This and and that.</h1></article>
```

## API

### `origin.use(rehype2retext, destination)`

[**rehype**][rehype] ([hast][]) plugin to bridge or mutate to
[**retext**][retext] ([nlcst][]).

###### `destination`

`destination` is either a parser or a processor.

If a processor ([`Unified`][processor]) is given, runs the destination
processor with the new nlcst tree, then, after running discards that tree and
continues on running the origin processor with the original tree
([bridge-mode][bridge]).

If a parser (such as [**parse-latin**][latin], [**parse-english**][english], or
[**parse-dutch**][dutch]) is given, passes the tree to further plugins
(mutate-mode).

As HTML defines paragraphs, that definition is used for
[**Paragraph**][paragraph]s: `<p>` and `<h1-6>` are explicitly
supported, and implicit paragraphs in flow content are also supported.
